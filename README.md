# EthereumCrowdCoin
- Managers create campaigns with a minimum contribution amount
- Users contribute to a campaign in ether which is stored in the smart-contract
- Managers make a spending request (ex. buy battery cases)
- All Users who have made a contribution must approve the spending request
- Once all approvals are received, manager finalizes the request and transfers ether from the smart-contract to a recipient address (ex- battery vendor )
